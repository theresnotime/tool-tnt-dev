I'm going to let my team know as a bit of accountability.</p>\n<h2 id=\"eleventy-what\" tabindex=\"-1\">Eleventy—<em>what?</em> <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://tnt-dev.toolforge.org/devlog/posts/2022/Hello%20World/#eleventy-what\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>A nice interesting (side)topic for this blog is going to be the fact that it's going to be built using <a href=\"https://www.11ty.dev/\">Eleventy</a>, a static site generator. Normally I'd use something like <a href=\"https://gohugo.io/\">Hugo</a> or <a href=\"https://jekyllrb.com/\">Jekyll</a> for this sort of thing, but I've been wanting to try out Eleventy for a while now, and this seems like a good opportunity to do so — plus learning a whole new tool is <em>always fun!</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"what-have-i-been-working-on-today\" tabindex=\"-1\"><s>What have I been working on today?</s> <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://tnt-dev.toolforge.org/devlog/posts/2022/Hello%20World/#what-have-i-been-working-on-today\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I was going to frame these posts as &quot;<em>What have I been working on today?</em>&quot;, but as a <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/night_owl#Noun\">night owl</a> &quot;today&quot;  often means &quot;<em>some of yesterday, some of today</em>&quot; — I think it's better to frame it as &quot;<em>What have I been working on recently?</em>&quot; just so I don't need to figure out days...</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-have-i-been-working-on-recently\" tabindex=\"-1\">What have I been working on recently? <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://tnt-dev.toolforge.org/devlog/posts/2022/Hello%20World/#what-have-i-been-working-on-recently\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h2>\n<h3 id=\"ipavalidator\" tabindex=\"-1\">IPAValidator <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"https://tnt-dev.toolforge.org/devlog/posts/2022/Hello%20World/#ipavalidator\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</a></h3>\n<p>As part of an <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Community_Wishlist_Survey_2022/Generate_Audio_for_IPA\">accepted Community Wishlist item</a>, I built a PHP composer library to validate and normalise <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet\">IPA</a> — initially this repo was on my personal GitHub account, but it was suggested during security review that it would be better to move it to <code>mediawiki/libs</code> on Gerrit.</p>\n<p>This move left some tidying up to do, which would contribute towards stalling further development, so my attention has primarily been on that — pretty cool that I wrote a library that's now being used by the MediaWiki proper!</p>\n<p>Go check out <a href=\"https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/g/mediawiki/libs/IPAValidator\">https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/g/mediawiki/libs/IPAValidator</a> (and please <em>please</em> improve <a href=\"https://regex101.com/r/f2Qhuk\">the regex</a>...)</p>\n<pre class=\"language-regex\"><code class=\"language-regex\"><span class=\"token anchor function\">^</span><span class=\"token char-class\"><span class=\"token char-class-punctuation punctuation\">[</span>().<span class=\"token range\">a<span class=\"token range-punctuation operator\">-</span>z</span>|æçðøħŋœ<span class=\"token range\">ǀ<span class=\"token range-punctuation operator\">-</span>ǃ</span><span class=\"token range\">ɐ<span class=\"token range-punctuation operator\">-</span>ɻ</span>ɽɾ<span class=\"token range\">ʀ<span class=\"token range-punctuation operator\">-</span>ʄ</span><span class=\"token range\">ʈ<span class=\"token range-punctuation operator\">-</span>ʒ</span>ʔʕʘʙ<span class=\"token range\">ʛ<span class=\"token range-punctuation operator\">-</span>ʝ</span>ʟʡʢʰʲʷʼˀˈˌːˑ˞ˠˡ<span class=\"token range\">ˤ<span class=\"token range-punctuation operator\">-</span>˩</span>̴̘̙̜̝̞̟̠̤̥̩̪̬̯̰̹̺̻̼̀́̂̃̄̆̈̊̋̌̏̽̚͜͡βθχ᷄᷅᷈‖‿ⁿⱱ<span class=\"token char-class-punctuation punctuation\">]</span></span><span class=\"token quantifier number\">+</span><span class=\"token anchor function\">$</span></code></pre>\n",
